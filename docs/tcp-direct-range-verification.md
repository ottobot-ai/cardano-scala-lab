# TCP direct-range acceptance evidence

Release: 0.16.0. Execution date: 2026-10-08 UTC. JDK 21, Scala 3.3.8,
Cats Effect 3.6.3. Final aggregate `scalafmtAll check app/runtimeClasspathFile` passed: **455/455 tests**,
including all 414 pre-existing tests and 41 added tests. All 16 selected offline/local
CLI, fixture, provenance and runtime verifiers passed (95 direct-JVM CLI cases in
total, including four new TCP help/preflight cases). The runtime inventory remains
26 jars; all five negative dependency-admission checks passed.

## Execution boundary

Only finite controlled IPv4 localhost acceptors and IPv6 loopback `::1` were used.
No public DNS, external endpoint, Euler, HTTP fallback, reference node startup,
live relay interoperability check, ledger execution or consensus validation was
performed. The implementation can connect to an explicit numeric endpoint when
invoked by its user; capability does not imply external execution evidence.

## New local gates

- Numeric address parsing, canonical IPv6 identity, malformed/ambiguous/unspecified/
  multicast/mapped addresses and transport hard caps
- Deterministic callback partial and zero I/O, synchronous registration failures,
  EOF, read/write/connect cancellation and deadlines, admission-wait cancellation,
  late connect completion, immediate close without direction permits. Queue admission
  is witnessed by negative semaphore counts; real read registration is witnessed
  after the JDK registration returns, not inferred from sleeps
- Cleanup-failure tests preserve the exact primary error, report secondary finalizer
  failure through the owned runtime reporter, and never turn failing cleanup after
  successful use into success
- Real nonreading localhost peer: sustained awaited writes, small socket buffers,
  finite attempted-byte ceiling, write timeout and closed connection; owned group
  and fixed executor termination asserted after release
- Real IPv6 loopback binding/connect/cleanup: passed on this environment, not skipped
- Strict descriptor and CLI preflight, UInt64/UInt32 boundaries, actual bounded
  provenance hash, changed filenames, duplicate/unknown fields, canonical optional
  pin order, impossible/out-of-range/duplicate pins and complete point-list checks
- Real TCP CLI handler runs for Shelley, Allegra and Babbage: original bytes unknown
  to preflight, literal independent wire scripts, fragmented messages (including
  one-byte fragmentation), exact stored bytes, observed SHA256, full and partial resume
- BatchDone withheld with an explicit synchronization signal: no objects before
  completion; wrong magic/version/query, protocol 2/8, direction, wrapper and length,
  missing/short/extra/duplicate/reordered bytes, EOF and NoBlocks fail closed
- Independent subset pins and full-pin pure policy checks; unmatched and mismatched
  pins fail. Same-header synthetic body mutation passes first structural-only
  unpinned acquisition but fails committed overlap replay without replacing objects
- Connector spy proves malformed input and changed resume endpoint/budgets open no
  connection; real acquisition cancellation preserves an empty checkpoint
- Virtual-time acquisition bound includes waiting for the transport before session
  allocation. Whole-deadline errors have typed TCP budget mapping; local fixture
  compatibility retains its existing error semantics

Existing shared-core tests also cover one-MiB framing, retained suffix rejection,
state/whole/trickle deadlines, append cancellation and locked atomic store recovery.
They remain inherited evidence for the same extracted core, not separate assertions
that arbitrary relays or bodies are valid.

## Reproduction

```sh
./scripts/sbtw scalafmtAll check app/runtimeClasspathFile
python3 scripts/verify-chain-fetch-cli.py
python3 scripts/verify-block-fetch-cli.py
python3 scripts/verify-post-byron-fixtures.py
python3 scripts/runtime-inventory.py
python3 scripts/verify-runtime-inventory.py
python3 scripts/verify-tcp-direct-range.py
```

The final build log is `tcp-direct-range-build-verification.log`; portable audit and
CLI regression output is `tcp-direct-range-regression-verification.log`. Cleanup
observation is bounded but no hard real-time guarantee is asserted for arbitrary
native JVM/OS or filesystem operations. Network/body/header-signature/ledger/
consensus/Mithril/reference replay truth flags remain false.
