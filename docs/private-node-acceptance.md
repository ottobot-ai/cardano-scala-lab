# Sustained volatile node acceptance plan

This records the integrated operational milestone plan and its passing local case
on 2026-10-09, with the scope and evidence below.
Use the ordinary `lab.Main node` command and its real argument parser. Keep the
reference launcher and offline audit separate from node execution; a post-oracle
must never seed online state. No durable compaction is supported.

## Fixed case

Use one reviewed private PV9/header11.2 fixture with supplied source-bound
bootstrap and twelve distinct forward blocks in a single epoch. Configure:

```text
node --profile conway-pv9-header11-2-derived-nonce-bounded-sequence-v1
  --bootstrap /evidence --port PORT --mode sustained-volatile
  --blocks 12 --rollback-capacity 4 --seconds 120 --events 128
  --bytes 33554432 --reconnects 0 --audit true
```

The early-epoch supplied anchor and twelve-block endpoint must leave enough time
in the existing epoch. Do not lengthen epochs or raise budgets in response to a
failed run. First observe an applied empty block, then submit the existing pair of
independent supported disposable transactions to the nonproducing relay. Require
an actual transaction-bearing original block, including both exact submitted
body/witness pairs together, rather than treating mempool admission as inclusion.

Require depth 12 and no repeated forward point. Capacity 4 must force checked
anchor advancement, with retained originals bounded to four and compacted depth
accounted separately. Revision and depth are separately reported. In the current implementation,
anchor advancement preserves revision; this straight-line case must finish at
revision 12, depth 12, compacted 8 and retained 4. All event/byte/time budgets remain
cumulative across compaction. One initial no-op rollback to the supplied anchor
is permitted and counted; later rollback/reconnect is not part of this case.

## Evidence and comparison

Readiness follows actual peer intersection and the checked coordinator anchor.
Record bootstrap provenance, acquisition cursors, committed applied progress,
every exact original envelope/block pair and final typed outcome. Acquired bytes
do not themselves imply validation. Require `TargetReached`, successful process
exit and finalized resources before accepting the online result. Budget or timeout
termination is a failed acceptance case and never a caught-up claim.

The node emits its token-free complete final state projection only in explicit
audit mode. After finalized node output and the complete projection are observed, pause
producers promptly within the existing bound and require the post-reference
endpoint to equal the exact node endpoint. Resume producers and verify the
ordinary process exited successfully before publishing the oracle manifest. Pin
poststate sources and captures in the existing oracle manifest. Run `node-audit`
separately: load the original bootstrap, replay every original with the same
capacity/compaction schedule, compare the entire final projection, revision and
derived-anchor provenance with the surviving node output, and compare full UTxO,
fees, counters, known nonce fields, parameters and stake/registration endpoints
with the reference. Equal endpoints do not prove continuity; same-epoch supported
transition checks provide the scoped path evidence.

Preserve raw prestate, originals, stdout, exact command/config, source and compiled
pins, timings and cleanup privately. Public evidence contains only reviewed code,
bounded summaries and hashes. Preserve every failed attempt. Never extend the
target, accept a later endpoint or automatically retry grouping/timing failures.

## Resource and review gates

One reference cluster uses at most 3 CPU/6 GiB; the ordinary node and later offline
audit use at most 1 CPU/1 GiB sequentially. Internal Docker networking only;
disposable keys/local test funds only; one slot totals 4 CPU/7 GiB and no more than
600 seconds including cleanup. Keep producer pauses at the existing pre/post
20-second and submission 8-second bounds. Unrelated containers are untouched.

Before the one live invocation: focused mode/config/status/audit/launcher tests,
combined source and exact command review, fresh private output, compiled-source
pins and a full integrated regression run. Hosted CI gates publication of the
integrated checkpoint. Independent development need not wait on CI. No cluster
is started merely by preparing this plan.

## Durable boundary

Reject `sustained-durable` explicitly. Checkpoint v1 rejects derived anchors even
with an empty suffix; the durable facade exposes no compaction. The separately
reviewed `ValidatorTransitions.Backend` seam owns session-bound candidates/tokens,
distinguishes volatile, loaded-verified and newly acknowledged state, and reports
terminal storage failure using qualified cached confirmation. Bounded durable
mode will be wired in its own milestone; the current case is volatile only.

## Recovery evidence provenance

The coordinating review approved backend seam commit
`929900948ee619f65498a13b3d25013a72a8822a` for a later integration after the sustained
volatile checkpoint. Its eight focused tests and source/class hashes were
reviewed independently. The separately reviewed graceful and post-acknowledgement
SIGKILL retained-file cases used the pinned `e7d1e6f` source: the killed process
exited 137 without OOM and a new process strictly recovered acknowledged state
before rollback/reapplication. These are process-recovery observations, not live
network continuation, compaction persistence or power-loss evidence.

One older raw 310-test adapter log was overwritten by a failed seam run and is
not retained evidence. Do not cite it as such. The separate 311-test follow-up and
the reviewed acceptance receipts remain available; the main integration's own
fresh tests and pins are recorded separately.

## Passed operational case

The reviewed invocation on source `352d09a144aa81aa4f4c324d887572c4cd4f60df`
completed in 230.145 seconds. It entered through ordinary `lab.Main node` argument
parsing, started from supplied block 55 at slot 1001, and applied twelve distinct
blocks 56–67 through slot 1453, all in epoch 2. The second block carried both
submitted transactions; the other eleven were empty. The node reached its target
at revision/depth 12, retained four originals and compacted eight. It reported
25 events, 21,042 returned payload bytes, zero reconnects and one peer opened and
closed. Eight checked anchor advances preserved cumulative progress.

The separate network-disabled audit matched the complete online projection,
revision and derived-anchor provenance, exact original capture and transaction
grouping, and the complete supported reference post-state checks. Independent
audit derived complete UTxO entries 6→8, preserved four untouched outputs and
400,000 lovelace in fees. Ledger/protocol checks use pinned JSON projections;
complete UTxO and original blocks have raw CBOR evidence. The unknown
previous-epoch nonce was not compared. The outer
harness completed its epoch-growth observation and removed all owned containers
and networks. The online twelve-block window itself remained within one epoch.
No durable compaction, live competing fork, epoch transition, full-ledger or
full-consensus claim follows from this case.

Capture SHA-256:

`206512653b71bbd7fc4b1ec2da37989e8380c191103e6732edca141e6b61476b`.
Raw exports, keys, logs and cluster state remain private.

Focused checks passed 101 Scala tests and nine launcher guards. The integrated
regression passed 1,203 Scala tests including retained-input cases and translator
tests, 25 public gates, 151 launcher guards (one compiler-dependent class skipped)
and 28 restart-controller guards. These are separately retained current logs.

The later raw ledger-CBOR side-export request arrived after the existing post
pause had finished; no extra pause, command change or deadline extension was added.
That export remains a separate capture task. Future epoch code must not treat
JSON `possibleRewardUpdate: null` as evidence that reward state is absent; the
coordinating research is designing a lossless explicit-variant bootstrap.


## Separate bounded durable ordinary-node case — first attempt failed

The reviewed create/resume implementation at
`87c714b701faaeb93da970e666939bd36d74b2b8` passed 89 focused Scala tests,
16 launcher guards, and formatting. Its integrated offline regression passed
1,237 Scala tests including retained inputs and the translator, 25 public gates,
167 launcher Python tests with one native-dependent class skipped, and 28 restart
guards. These checks do not establish ordinary-node live restart acceptance.

The first reviewed isolated invocation stopped during the pre-state raw ledger
export. The CLI query and file-size check succeeded, but Docker archive-copy
reported that the output file was absent. The failure occurred before node A
started and before either test transaction was submitted. No raw CBOR file was
retained on the host, so epoch-exporter compatibility remains untested.

The pre-state pause lasted 7.770 seconds. The complete attempt and task-owned
cleanup took 184.100 seconds, with no containers or networks remaining. Evidence
is preserved privately at `/home/euler/cardano-node-durable-live1-20261009` and
the matching integration directory. No automatic retry followed. A transport
fix must pass synthetic binary-copy checks and independent review before a fresh,
separately pinned invocation. This failure does not alter the accepted twelve-
block volatile result or the separate retained-file restart evidence above.


## Bounded durable follow-up — passed

The separately reviewed follow-up at source
`99f37c1e2d739736880b113d623b89b211025d6b` passed. The narrow binary export fix
passed 172 launcher guards (one native-dependent class skipped) and two synthetic
binary probes. All 1,712 compiled entries remained identical to the fully tested
Scala milestone; no ledger, runner or checkpoint semantics changed for the fix.

The supplied anchor was block 66, slot 1505, epoch 3. Process A acknowledged two
empty live blocks and exited successfully at revision/generation 2. A separately
retained, hash-pinned receipt selected the exact checkpoint for process B. B loaded
the identical complete state at generation 2, kept that classification through its
no-op intersection, then acknowledged two newly acquired live blocks through
revision/generation 4. The transaction pair appeared in block 70 (the fourth new
block); the other three blocks were empty. Final slot was 1769, still in epoch 3.

Independent evidence review verified both receipt hashes, checkpoint payload and
trailer digests, 15 input/oracle pins, exact original bytes, complete final state,
five nonce fields, counters, whole UTxO 6→8 with four untouched outputs, and
400,000 lovelace in fees. The unknown previous-epoch nonce was not compared.
Both processes exited 0 without OOM; each peer opened and closed once. Total
attempt and cleanup elapsed 279.247 seconds. Pre/restart/post pauses were
7.980/2.903/5.696 seconds. No task-owned containers or networks remained.

Private evidence is `/home/euler/cardano-node-durable-live2-20261009`. The original
failed attempt, its source/classpath pin, and its build remain preserved. The
successful source/classpath pin is `attempt2-source-classpath-pin.json` in the
matching integration directory, SHA-256
`1d82d504590bc1e878d2997015461e020f4b2543d074d64332ff22d36f2b4aec`.
The four-original capture SHA-256 is `71dc64fb41e2cb528fdca427dd8a88852d32278c7e8b034053a3574c8b7fd245`.

The raw pre ledger export is 11858 bytes, SHA-256
`37c805e549e69ccfb9caed93af678a85b9dc982e949e9e9f1c03e269912b0716`; post is 11892 bytes, SHA-256
`2ade2f22e2e050f624e9f41a5124f5347f4c66a666a7f1c505c94b586a4ee655`. Original bytes are hash-bound to the executed CLI and
stable paused tip brackets; each is one complete CBOR item. Native epoch-exporter
compatibility remains untested here. The retained attribution addendum clarifies
that `sourceCliCommit` in the original receipts was the query source examined
(`eac27b8…`), not a verified build-source assertion. The actual CLI embedded
revision is `938cba990357ae7c4b7f95c8f75dd9d31174bbeb`, with binary SHA-256
`0ac45e874599fac4ee6ca4fd9602c0ddb9854a62be5f365dfa425eff9f4bd0ed`.
Future receipts use `examinedQuerySourceCommit` to make that distinction explicit.

This is bounded graceful durable restart plus live continuation. It does not show
power-loss recovery, live competing forks, epoch transitions, durable compaction,
full ledger validation or full consensus. The outer reference growth observation
continued into later epochs; the validated four-block window stayed in epoch 3.
State exports remain separate acquisitions under observed quiescence.
